  description: '<p>I am a Full Stack Developer from the United States. I have had an interesting  journey in my career and it has given me a unique perspective on technology. I built my first computer when I was 10 years old. I started coding with Visual Basic when I was 12. By the time I was 16, I was working Technical Support for an ISP. Presently, I would describe myself as a Full Stack Solutions Developer. Throughout my career I have worked on a wide range of projects for a diverse set of organizations. I have a passion for working with teams from all over the globe and I love to travel. My experience as a developer comes from my love of solving complex problems with technical solutions. Last year I moved to the United Kingdom and currently live in London. </p>'
